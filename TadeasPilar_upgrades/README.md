## Manual PNP turntable
#Improvements by [Tadeáš Pilaø](https://github.com/TadeasPilar/)

This is my spin at improving the Manual PNP turntable by [Seon aka the Unexpected Maker](https://github.com/UnexpectedMaker)
Made to solve my personal needs in the limited time I had to play with this. Feel free to critisize, redo, or outright refuse my ideas :D

This is compilation of several unrelated changes to the original design. Each of them can be used separatly or all together.
List below lists all the improvments and parts you will have to reprint. Parts I don't mention are same as in the original design.
Images below this list.

##They are:
#- Lock ring to hold the plexi in place
    No need to glue or tape the plexiglass. 
    You will need to print new [turntable base](stl/turntable_base.stl) and [lock ring](stl/turntable_lock_ring.stl).
    Held in by several M3x5 self-tapped machine screws(the flat head type). 
    There are holes for 7 screws, but I find 3 are enough.

#- Component tray with joined compartments
    Do you have bigger smd parts to store? No problem.
    Use my [new component tray](stl/turntable_component_tray_joined_compartments.stl)  with several compartments joined together.
    Expect more wariants of this to appear in the future.
    
#- No ball bearings - no problem!!!
    [3D printable rings](stl/turntable_bearings.stl) to replace ball bearings.
    Not as smoothm, but definitely usable.
    Beware of limitations of plastic slip bearings. They will not last! But definitely good enough while you wait for real ballbearings to arrive.
    
#- Easy tape fill funnel
    [Funnel variant](stl/turntable_funnel_12x2mm_tape.stl) made for easy filling from tape. 
    Pull tape through(upside down), then using tweezers, loop cover tape back throug the lower hole.
    Now, just pull on the tape and watch your parts neatly pour to your selected compartment.
    WARNING!!! Pulling the cover tape through is real pain in the ass. Only realy worth it if you have lot of parts to get out of the tape.
